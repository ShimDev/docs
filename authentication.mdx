## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer sk_live_xxxxx
```

### Example Request

```typescript
const response = await fetch('https://api.shim.so/v1/repair', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer sk_live_xxxxx',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ raw_output: '{"broken": "json"' })
});
```

---

## Key Format

- **Production keys:** `sk_live_xxxxx`
- **Test keys:** `sk_test_xxxxx` (coming soon)

<Warning>
Never commit API keys to version control. Use environment variables:
```bash
export SHIM_API_KEY=sk_live_xxxxx
```
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### 401 Unauthorized

**Cause:** Invalid or missing API key  
**Fix:** Check that your key is correct and included in the `Authorization` header

### 429 Too Many Requests

**Cause:** Rate limit exceeded  
**Fix:** Implement exponential backoff or upgrade your tier
